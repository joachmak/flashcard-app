### What is this

This is SciCard. It is a flashcard app that (in its current state) supports

- LaTex formatting
- Code formatting

it almost supports

- Image insertion (coming this year, hopefully)

and in the future, it will also (maybe) support

- Markdown formatting (probably not a lot of work, so it's also coming soon™)

### Motivation

Quizlet (that I love and use a lot) only lets you upload 1 image on 1 side of the card. The image is very compressed and if there is text, it can become difficult to read.
Also, Quizlet has very bad support for mathematical formulas. They have a menu full of mathematical symbols, but that is not enough if you study something related to engineering. This is why I wanted to make a flashcard app with support for LaTex formatting.

Anki is a bit better than Quizlet, but I find the styling to be a bit off-putting. Also, I didn't make Anki, so it's not as fun as this.

### Known bugs / issues

- The "download cards" feature doesn't work with images right now. Images generally don't work yet, so this is not a huge surprise.
- Poor performance / lag: I will work on improving performance soon™.
- Once, the program crashed when I was creating a set and I lost some cards. I am considering to add an autosave / backup feature. This feature is also coming soon™.
